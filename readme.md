# Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Learning Exercises (2025)

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository! This repository contains the exercises and projects I have worked on throughout the year 2025 in the fields of Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Statistical Learning. The primary aim of this repository is to document my learning journey and share my work with others who might find it useful.
